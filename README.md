# 🌍 Global Seismic Trends: Data-Driven Earthquake Insights

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes global earthquake data obtained from the USGS Earthquake API to identify seismic patterns, trends, and high-risk regions using data analytics techniques.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics pipeline, converting raw seismic data into actionable insights to support disaster preparedness and seismic risk assessment.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Earthquake data is large, complex, and unstructured, making it difficult to extract meaningful insights without proper data processing and analysis.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- USGS Earthquake API
- Python
- Pandas
- SQL & MySQL
- Streamlit

---

## 🔄 Project Workflow
1. Retrieve real-time earthquake data from the USGS API  
2. Clean and preprocess data using Python and Pandas  
3. Store structured data in a MySQL database  
4. Perform analytical queries using SQL  
5. Visualize insights using an interactive Streamlit dashboard
